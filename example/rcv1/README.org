Examples run applications on data RCV1.

Use =data/rcv1_small.sh= or =data/rcv1_large.sh= to prepare the dataset.

Script =script/local.sh= can be used to start multiple processes in local
machine.

Examples to run l1-regularized logistic regression:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd script
# block coordinate descent with 1 server and 4 workers:
./local.sh ../build/ps 1 4 -app_file ../example/rcv1/batch_l1lr.conf
# online gradient descent with 1 server and 4 workers:
./local.sh ../build/ps 1 4 -app_file ../example/rcv1/online_l1lr.conf
# test the trained models
./local.sh ../build/ps 0 0 -app_file ../example/rcv1/eval_batch.conf
./local.sh ../build/ps 0 0 -app_file ../example/rcv1/eval_online.conf
#+END_SRC
