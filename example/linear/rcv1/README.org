Examples run applications on data RCV1.

First, download the dataset by =./rcv1_small.sh= or =./rcv1_large.sh=

Then we can run the system by either building the binary or downloading a docker images.

*Run in local*

Use the binary you compiled to run l1-regularized logistic regression:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# block coordinate descent with 1 server and 4 workers:
../../../script/local.sh ../../../build/ps 1 4 -app_file batch_l1lr.conf
# online gradient descent with 1 server and 4 workers:
../../../script/local.sh ../../../build/ps 1 4 -app_file online_l1lr.conf
# test the trained models
../../../script/local.sh ../../../build/ps 0 0 -app_file eval_batch.conf
../../../script/local.sh ../../../build/ps 0 0 -app_file eval_online.conf
#+END_SRC

Or run the same application by [[www.docker.com][docker:]]

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ../../../docker/local.sh 1 1 batch_l1lr.conf data model
#+END_SRC
